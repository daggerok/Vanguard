# Vanguard

One of the app's features lets you select Vanguard ETFs in the Watchlist and aggregate their holdings to see how often each ticker appears across the selected funds. Repeated holdings make overlapping exposure visible: the more selected funds include a ticker, the greater its potential influence on the portfolio; gains in that holding may help, while declines may hurt, and actual impact also depends on each fund's position size.  Another feature makes it faster and easier to find funds with stronger growth over different periods, higher dividend yields or distributions, greater Total Return (price performance plus dividends), and other key performance metrics. A single-file client-side tool that reads the generated `./api/vanguard` static feed (official Vanguard fund metrics and holdings, official NAV/premium-discount history merged by date with Yahoo Finance for OHLC/volume and distributions, SEC EDGAR N-PORT-P as fallback) into a searchable ETF/asset-class catalog with per-fund tabs, watchlist aggregation, ticker copy and CSV/TXT export — the same look, feel, columns and business logic as the sibling applications.

## Using Bun

```bash
bunx degit daggerok/Vanguard#main ./12345 && cd $_
bunx serve . -p 1234
open http://0:1234
```

The published application is available at <https://daggerok.github.io/Vanguard/>.

## Updating the static Vanguard data

Run the updater with Bun:

```bash
bun test
bun scripts/update-data.ts
```

Run `bun scripts/update-data.ts -h` (or `--help`) to print every control with its default and usage examples.

Defaults live in `scripts/update-data.config.json` (every control as a string). The **Update Vanguard ETF data** GitHub Actions workflow and the command line use the same `resolveControls` function from `scripts/update-data.ts`. Precedence: file defaults < `advanced` JSON < nonblank workflow inputs < protected Actions variable/environment. A blank workflow input inherits the file value, and scheduled runs use the file defaults as-is. Controls without an individual workflow input are set through the `advanced` JSON object, e.g. `{"SEC_UA": "my-tool contact@example.org"}`. All supplied filters use **AND** logic.

### Data sources

| Block | Source |
| --- | --- |
| Catalog (all US Vanguard ETFs) | Fund list embedded in the updater (`FUNDS_SEED`), checked against `https://investor.vanguard.com/etf/list` and `https://api.vanguard.com/rs/gre/gra/1.7.0/datasets/auw-holdings` (official API) |
| Holdings per fund | `https://investor.vanguard.com/investment-products/etfs/profile/{TICKER}#holdings` (holdings table) |
| Daily NAV/market-price/premium-discount history | Same `AdditionalFundData` response's `historicalPrice` + `premiumDiscountDetails` blocks (official, merged by date; ~21 months of daily premium/discount, longer month-end-only NAV) |
| Daily OHLC/volume; distributions; history fallback | Yahoo Finance chart API - the only source for Open/High/Low/Volume and for dividend/split events, and for any date the official blocks above don't cover |
| Fallback | SEC EDGAR N-PORT-P for holdings fallback |

### Metrics and caveats

Each fund carries a derived `metrics` object that powers the catalog columns shared with the sibling sites:

- `ytd` / `tr1y` - official YTD and 1-year returns -> *YTD Return*, *TR 1Y*
- `cagr3y` / `cagr5y` / `cagr10y` - published annualized 3Y/5Y/10Y figures -> *CAGR 3Y/5Y/10Y*
- `tr3y` / `tr5y` / `tr10y` - cumulative 3Y/5Y/10Y figures `(1 + CAGR)^n - 1` -> *TR 3Y/5Y/10Y*
- `siAnn` - since-inception annualized -> *SI Ann.*
- `dividendYield` - 12-month trailing yield or indicated yield (latest distribution x frequency / price), an estimate derived from Yahoo Finance distributions and price
- `secYield` - 30-day SEC yield when published; `-` otherwise

Official NAV, market price and premium/discount come from Vanguard; Open/High/Low/Volume and distributions come from Yahoo Finance and are not official fund data. Values a source does not publish are left unavailable, not zero. Each holdings sheet records its as-of date and source, and SEC N-PORT-P is used only when the Vanguard feed has no holdings.

### Update controls

| Environment variable | Default | Meaning |
| --- | --: | --- |
| `REQUEST_SLEEP` | `0` | Seconds to wait after each fund update (nonnegative number). |
| `CONCURRENCY` | `4` | Number of parallel fund update workers (integer >= 1). |
| `TICKERS` | all | Space-, comma- or semicolon-separated ticker allowlist, e.g. `VTI VOO BND VUG`; empty updates every fund. |
| `HOLDINGS_PAGE_SIZE` | `250` | Rows in each generated current-holdings JSON page (integer >= 1). |
| `HISTORY_PAGE_SIZE` | `1000` | Rows in each generated daily-history JSON page (integer >= 1). |
| `MAX_RETRIES` | `2` | Retries after the initial SEC request (integer >= 0, at most 5 are used). Only HTTP 408/425/429/5xx are retried, with exponential backoff. |
| `SEC_UA` | empty | Override the SEC User-Agent; empty uses the declared repository descriptor. In Actions the protected `SEC_UA` repository variable wins when nonblank. |
| `VERBOSE` | `false` | Print per-fund retry and fallback notices (`true`/`false`). |

Funds not selected by `TICKERS` keep their prior published metadata and data files. The earlier `MAX_FETCHES`, `AUM`, `DIVIDEND_YIELD`, `PERFORMANCE_*`, `TOTAL_RETURN_*` and `STORE_RAW_DOWNLOADS` settings were never read by the updater and are no longer accepted.

### Examples

```bash
TICKERS="VTI VOO BND VUG" bun scripts/update-data.ts
CONCURRENCY=2 REQUEST_SLEEP=1 bun scripts/update-data.ts
VERBOSE=true TICKERS=VOO bun scripts/update-data.ts
```

## TypeScript and verification

The browser app is intentionally build-free: `index.html` carries the markup, styles and bootstrap, and `app.tsx` is TypeScript compiled in the browser with Babel standalone - no build step, no bundler, no `tsconfig.json` needed. Bun runs TypeScript out of the box.

Verification before every publish:

```bash
bun install --frozen-lockfile
bun test
bun build --target=bun scripts/update-data.ts --outfile=/dev/null
git diff --check
```

`bun test` also checks that the config file, `CONTROL_NAMES`, `--help` and the controls table above agree, and that the workflow inputs map to controls.
